## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (Kind of)
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

Besides the experience gained of practicing what I had previously learned, I leaned about background images, something that I had not used before.
Code snippet below:

```css
.daniel {
    background-color: hsl(263, 55%, 52%);
    background-image: url(images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg); /* quotes background */
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 360px 0;
    background-size: 95px;
}
```


### Continued development

Once again I had trouble with screen responsiveness. It took a long time to make 3 screen sizes, I assume there is a faster way to adjust the size of the site.
Before I start my next challange I will work this out.
